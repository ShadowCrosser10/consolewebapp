<h1>My Console Web App!</h1>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>Hi everyone! This is one of my first console web apps, built with Visual Studio Code. In this webpage, you have to go to the "Console" screen to view some functions, like .concat or console.log(). To get to the Console screen, do => Right Click, => Inspect, => Console =>, and viola! You have the console screen. Thanks for visiting this website!</p>

<script>
var first_name = "Aditya";
var name_is = "My first name is: "; 
console.log(first_name.concat(name_is))
var last_intital = "A.";
var last_initial_is = "My last intial is: "
console.log(last_initial_is.concat(last_intital))


var full_name = first_name.concat(last_intital)
console.log(full_name);

var length_of_something = "The length of my first name is: "
console.log(length_of_something.concat(first_name.length))


console.log(1, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105);
console.log(Math.min(1, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105));
console.log(Math.max(1, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105));
